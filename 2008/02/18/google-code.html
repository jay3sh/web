          <p>If you don't already know, I have been working on a little software <a href="http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas/">project</a>, that lets you publish images to Flickr and Picasa. What is different about it is, it works as a plugin in image editing software like Gimp and Inkscape; and now it also works on Nokia's internet tablets. Yesterday I released v0.5 of it.  </p>
<p>But this post is not about my project, it's about its hosting site. I have done open source projects before on other hosting sites - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xenen">xenen</a> on Sourceforge, <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/faint/">faint</a> on Maemo garage - but I found their web interfaces very â€¦ awkward. They look pre-historic compared to today's web 2.0 interfaces (Note: this is just about UI, SourceForge deserves lot more credit for what it has achieved beyond UI). So when I came to know about Google code I was extremely happy. When I came to know about it (that was already after 1 year it had lanched), the UI was still very simple. It didn't have all the features SourceForge had. But I had a gut feeling that it will have the finest features in the future to come, only because it is Google.  </p>
<p>And I was right. One of the very useful they have recently added is source code browsing. Their previous code browsing was as plain as firefox's file:// browser. But I had a feeling that Google will be putting an extremely well SVN browsing interface that matches their style. And they did. Browse my project's source code <a href="http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas/source/browse">here</a> and see it for yourself. The browsing of entire source files, their older revisions and the diffs - everything is just how it should be. It just makes open source project development lot of fun. Thanks to Google code team for this new feature.  </p>
<p>I have some good things to say about Google codesearch as well, but I will save it for next post.</p>

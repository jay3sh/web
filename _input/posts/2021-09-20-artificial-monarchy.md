Artificial Monarchy
===
Traditionally the monarchy was awarded to people that had royal ancestry. The myths that established their royal ancestry were arbitrary, but they were agreed upon by majority of the ruled populace. In the age of science itâ€™s difficult to convince everybody of the similar myths that would assign a regal status to some arbitrary individual. In our age a leader has to be capable to lead people. However a monarch is not a leader. He/She is a sovereign. They are a symbol. They are a representation of a nation's power concentrated in single human being. In a democratic setup they cannot unilaterally excercise that power. They only act as a human face of that power.

Can an artificially intelligent entity be made into a Monarch?

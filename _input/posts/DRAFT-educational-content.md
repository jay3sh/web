When I started developing games I wanted to make "educational" games. My definition of "educational" was very narrow and misguided at the time.

Two aspects:
* The entertainment media like video games, is more suitable to communicate curiosity for the knowledge, rather than the knowledge itself.
* Defining educational content as in well defined fields like Mathematics or Science is a trap for you mind. It will imprison you into thinking of education as what's taught in traditional educational system.

Why did I want to make educational games?
* It made me feel more "respectable". It replaced the primary goal of a video game (entertainment) by a vain idea.

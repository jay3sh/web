Thoughts on Perfection
===

If you are a creative professional trying to make a commercial product, you have to decide on the extent of perfection you want to achieve. It's essensial to understand the trade-offs involved in achieving or forgoing the perfection in your work.

Perfection originates from the creator's internal need for order. You may want all the corners in your painting to be perfect right angles or you may want beats in your background music to exactly coincide with the punches that the hero character throws in your video game. These aspects of your work may only be noticeable to power users of your finished product. They may or may not be necessary for serving the core purpose. The resulting work may still be complete without them. However such a product won't satisfy your vision of the product. It won't be Perfect. Works created with such pursuit for perfection can result in monumental works of art or they could never come in to being because you give up in frustration. Therefore it's important to understand the drive behind your need for perfection.

When Steve Jobs' carpenter spends too much time on the back of a cabinet that no one will ever see, he is doing it to amuse himself. If it gives you some joy as a creator, then do it. It's same as wanting a clean and tidy house. There's nothing wrong with it. But it's futile if you are spending all the time cleaning it and don't know how to enjoy living in it. Similarly when it comes to making a creative product, it's necessary to keep in mind that you are making it to be used by someone and not just to fulfill your need for order.

A drive for perfection that is rooted in hubris is misguided.

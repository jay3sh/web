On media as a One way communication
===
In some cases, when a complicated or controversial topic is communicated through a one-way channel of communication like a book or a movie, it's better understood than in a face-to-face communication.

Let's say in a novel the writer makes a claim that the oncoming car looked like a bull charging in a blind fury. It may be hard for the readers to picture a car in the form of a bull. But they cannot protest and argue that it's an impossible metaphor, because they cannot talk to the writer. But as they keep reading, they try to reimagine their concept of a car and a bull and come up with a vision that makes sense to them. Each person may come with their own unique image of such a car, but it will make sense to them. 

This is true about any claims or observations that a writer makes in his writing and the readers disagree or don't understand them initially. Because they cannot talk back, they are bound to extend his imagination to see the writer's point of view. In this process they grow intellectually. They develop empathy.

However if one makes such a point in a face-to-face conversation, the listener has a chance to immediately respond and express their disagreement. Once they have registered their disagreement, they may not bother reflecting upon the point. Thus loosing an opportunity to empathize.

A two way communication is great for many reasons too. But one way communication can be more effective in making the audience empathise with you.

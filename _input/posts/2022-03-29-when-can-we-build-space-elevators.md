When can we build Space elevators?
===

The hurdles in building a Space elevator are not just limited to the availability and cost of a novel material. It's well understood that we need a strong to create the cable that starts from ground and reaches the geo-synchronous orbit. At the same time it will also have to be light weight. A likely candidate is available in the form of Carbon Nanotubes. However abundant and cheap manufacturing of this material is not the only problem. I would like to discuss a new technology paradigm that will be needed to achieve this feat.

Let’s talk about this problem in the light of the history of advancements of Software technologies.

The software programs that we write today (AI, Video games, Content creation tools) are orders of magnitude more sophisticated than their punch card counterparts from 60 years ago. One could say that this difference of complexity is comparable to the difference between constructing a Space elevator and building a bridge. What allowed us to make such exponential progress in the development of software systems?

We do not spend any time in building a Software. Do we? It’s an automated process. We just fire off the compilers and linkers and the Software is ready. We take it for granted. Not only can we build the program for free, we can also execute it to see how it will behave in real world.  Most of the time is spent in designing the architecture of the software, then writing and debugging it. 

However, when it comes to building a skyscraper, the project is far from over once the architect has designed it. The actual job is done by Civil engineers and the construction workers. The concrete and steel is not going to self assemble itself into a skyscraper. What if it could? That would be the day, we will be able to take on the challenges as grand as building a Space elevator.

We need automated matter manipulation at zero cost. That will allow us to rapidly build our design. If the resulting structure fails, the nanobots can reuse the same matter in the rubble to build the next iteration of the structure.

Our ability to create increasingly complex software systems has progressed so rapidly, because there’s no cost involved in actually building the final software product. If we are writing a brand new algorithm, we just write few lines of code, compile it into an executable and see if it produces desired output. The cost of failure is almost zero.

When we can automate the assembly of matter, we will be able to have the same ability of rapid prototyping towards building physical structures. That will take us closer to building a Space elevator.

We need automated matter manipulation at zero cost, the same way we have automated information manipulation at zero cost today.

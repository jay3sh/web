          <p>There are many aspects of our culture that can be called flamboyant, lavish and
egregiously wasteful; yet we just love them. Take "Formula 1" for example.
The amount of fuel these cars burn and the amount of cash their manufacturers
spend to design and manufacture them, is shocking. But like many others I am a
huge fan of Formula 1 races. Almost inhuman speed, unimaginable power, glamorous
look and the sound that literally shakes you to the core - what's there not to like.
Despite the guilt of burning so much precious fuel, I would definitely want to
be in one of these super cars.</p>
<p>So this morning, it was very satisfying to read <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/25158104">the news about the new F1 rules
and the motive behind them.</a> The
new rules require the teams to use different engines in the cars (V6 instead of
V8). There are more restrictions on the total fuel they can use and the rate at
which they can use them. There is more emphasis on use of electric motors (2
instead of 1), or what's called the "Energy recovery system". What's most
notable however is the motive behind these new restrictions.</p>
<p>The idea is to bring F1 into line with cutting-edge road-car technology, and to
stimulate research and development in that area. The name of the game is
efficiency - using much less fuel to generate the same performance. The idea
is to increase fuel efficiency by as much as 40%.</p>
<p>This is a way of channeling the competition of a sport towards the betterment
of our society. The new feats of engineering happen when they are pushed to the
limits and then some more. Then over time they become commonplace and part of
everyday life - in this case improving the car we drive to the shopping mall.</p>
<p>It gives some meaning to our celebration of Formula 1</p>

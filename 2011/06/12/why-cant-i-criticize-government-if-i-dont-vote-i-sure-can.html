          <p>Why do people say that you cannot criticize a Government if you do not vote? I disagree. I have every right to criticize a Government as long as I pay taxes, whether I vote or not.  </p>
<p>There are only so many choices when you have to choose from candidates to run a Government. They differ in their agenda for the office only on some key issues - and they are the ones which are popular among the masses at the time. Such topics involve, their opinion on certain economic strategy, or their approval/disapproval of some social/religious issue, military strategy with neighboring nations, etc.  </p>
<p>But a Government has to do a lot of things other than these issues when it is in office and those things are the same no matter which set of politicians get to do it (actually it's the administrative staff that does the actual work, elected politicians are there only to say yes or no, and the administrative staff is not elected by people). Such things involve releasing a financial budget every year, or repairing public infrastructure every once in a few years, and so on. No matter which party is ruling, they will make more or less same decisions on most of these issues. Moreover, when we say the certain Government changed the course of a country's economy by setting such-and-such new policy, we cannot say for certain that the opposing party would have make any different decision had they been in office, because a bulk of that decision is based on some objective facts related to that matter which are the same irrespective of who is dealing with them.  </p>
<p>Therefore, which party gets elected to the office is irrelevant when it comes to performing bulk of Government's jobs.  </p>
<p>Moreover, your single vote doesn't mean anything. It means a lot to you, but it doesn't mean anything when it comes to influence a country's decision. When millions of people vote to elect a candidate, each one of them deserves a millionth of the blame if the candidate screws up in office or a millionth of credit if the candidate brings prosperity to the people. The ability or inability of the candidate and his/her administrative staff is far more important than who elected him/her to the office. So don't beat yourself to death if the candidate you voted for caused a war that killed millions for no reason, or don't rejoice because the candidate you voted for brought barrels of oil back home.  </p>
<p>Besides, the issues that you consider while voting, are rarely the only ones your elected candidate has to deal with during his stay in the office.  </p>
<p>You affect a Government more by paying taxes than casting a vote. The richer you are, and the more taxes you pay, you can be sure that a larger portion of it is being used for running the country/state/city. (Don't be naive. Never the 100% of your tax money is going to be used in the fashion you want it to be. There are way too many agendas in public organizations for that to happen. And corruption is never zero.)  </p>
<p>Tax money is what enables the Governments to execute. Your vote may contribute to which direction the execution takes place.  </p>
<p>Which one do you think is more important? One millionth part of the public opinion, which plays a fractional role in what the Government is going to decide on certain administrative issue; or hundreds/thousands of dollars that you paid in your annual taxes.  </p>
<p>So don't tell me that I don't deserve to criticize a Government because I didn't go to put a stamp on ballot paper.</p>

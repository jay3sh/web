          <p>Once upon a time there was a random number generator. It used to generate numbers without any break. After a while all the numbers it generated started piling up. Since they were all random numbers, some of them were smart and some of them were dumb. The smart ones started grouping together. They formed sets, they formed lists, they formed matrices. Some of the groups whose numbers had common factors went along fine and they grew bigger in size. Other random structures which didn't find anything common, just faded in time.   </p>
<p>The random groups of random numbers had vast variety in their structures. After a while they started categorizing each others. Some of them became male random structures and others became female random structures.  </p>
<p>Then they invented equation. When a male random structure and a female random structure used to sit together on one side of the equation, they would form a completely new random structure on the other side of the equation. This was pretty cool. Now the random number community grew many folds.  </p>
<p>Some very smart random structures invented new random structures that they could use for their own good.  </p>
<p>The random numbers evolved over time. Months, years, decades, centuries, milleniaâ€¦ a lot of time passed. The random structures became very advanced. They created new complicated structures. They made houses, they made schools, they made temples, they made offices, they made roads to travel to those offices, they made phones, they made TVs and they made iPods. They did what they could to not look random anymore.</p>

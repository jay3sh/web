          <p>The Brexit and Trump phenomenon happened because there was a great divide in general population on political issues. The choices that were rationally superior, were not favored by the majority. The elite group of society didn't see how anyone could vote to leave EU or elect Trump. But the working class group did not agree with them and felt completely oppressed by the status quo. This later group could only show their frustration with their vote and that's what they did. The results surprised everyone and have proved disastrous. The world is going to have to deal with these results, but in order to avoid them happening again we need to close this gap in the society.</p>
<p>There is a way in which I believe Internet can help address this problem. I'm going to write down the concept in this post. Let's call this website dialog.org.</p>
<p>When a user visits this website, he/she is asked a random political question from a pool of questions. The question has Yes/No answer. For example,</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe US should build a $4bn wall on its border with Mexico?</strong></p>
<p>If the person answers <strong>Yes</strong>, he/she will be put in a chat room with a person who has answered <strong>No</strong>. Both of them will be anonymous to each other. The chat room will be private and only the two can talk to each other. But if both of them agree, they can choose to make it public for others to read later.</p>
<p>Can somebody build this? Or can an existing website (say Reddit) be used in this way?</p>
